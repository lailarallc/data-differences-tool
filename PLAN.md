# data-differences-tool — Current Work Plan

The current arc of work. Updated when the arc changes, not every
session. For session-by-session state, see HANDOFF.md.

---

## Goal

Make the Data Differences Tool presentable enough to hand a CEO, CFO, or
consultant a naked link with no explanation needed.

## Why this arc, why now

v1.0 is functionally complete. The gap is first-impression credibility:
no favicon, no link preview, no branding, and the /improve audit is
overdue. This is a 30–60 minute pass, not a feature arc.

## Tasks

### 1. Favicon + Apple touch icon
- [x] Add Lailara favicon (SVG 32×32 + ICO fallback)
- [x] Add to `index.html` `<head>`
- [ ] Apple touch icon 180×180 PNG (needs conversion tool — deferred)

### 2. HTML meta tags
- [x] `<title>`: "Data Differences Tool — Lailara LLC"
- [x] `<meta name="description">`
- [x] OG tags (og:title, og:description, og:type=website, og:url)
- [x] Twitter card (summary + title + description)

### 3. Lailara wordmark in footer
- [x] "Built by Lailara LLC" text link in footer
- [x] Links to lailarallc.com
- [x] Subtle — warm-gray, underlined, centered

### 4. Visual QA pass
- [ ] Full click-through on desktop: upload CSV pair, XLSX pair, mixed
- [ ] Verify auto-detect copy is clear
- [ ] Verify download buttons work (Excel + CSV)
- [x] Check mobile viewport (iPhone SE width minimum) — zones stack, no overflow at 375px
- [ ] Confirm fonts load (Playfair Display headings, Source Sans 3 body)

### 5. /improve audit-only
- [x] Run /improve (full pass, 2026-07-27) + full code review + UI review
- [x] Fix P1 findings (CSV formula injection)
- [x] Fix P2 findings that were safe (perf, export errors, warnings, stale auto-detect, dead reordered data)
- [ ] Blank-key matching semantics: deliberately NOT changed — intentional + tested. See open question in Improvement History.

### 6. Redeploy
- [x] `npm run deploy`
- [ ] Verify live at diff.lailarallc.com
- [ ] Spot-check OG preview (paste URL in Slack or https://metatags.io)

### 7. Un-pinned defect — test is waiting, fix is not written

Added 2026-07-28 by the FIX-LIST cross-repo test sweep. `it.fails` is vitest's
strict xfail: the suite fails loudly the moment the fix lands and the marker
has to come off. Do not remove a marker without doing the fix.

- [x] **Identical verdict ignores column changes.** Fixed 2026-07-28: the gate
      now consults `columnChanges` and leads with the column finding. Both
      un-pinned tests are live, plus three new cases.
      `src/lib/summary-generator.ts:13` — the identical-verdict gate checks
      only added/removed/modified row counts, so a file whose rows all match
      but which gained a column reports "Files are identical. No differences
      found." Add `result.columnChanges.length === 0` to the gate and lead
      with the column finding ("No row values changed. 1 column added:
      discount."). The same sentence is written to Excel at
      `src/lib/export.ts:60` — fix both in one commit. Tests:
      `tests/lib/summary-generator.test.ts` —
      `does not claim identical when a column was added but no row changed`,
      `leads with the column finding when rows match but columns changed`.

### 8. Tier C review list — 2026-07-28

Seven of eight findings fixed this session, one commit each.

- [x] **[Critical]** Identical verdict ignores column changes (item 7 above).
- [x] **[Medium]** "Files are identical" overclaims — now "No material
      differences after tolerant matching." See DECISIONS.md.
- [x] **[Medium]** `wasNormalized` rendered nowhere — now tagged in the
      expanded row table and carried as a `Normalized` column in both exports.
- [x] **[Medium]** `dayjs(str)` formatted the fallback date parse in local
      time — now `dayjs.utc(str)`.
- [x] **[Medium]** Test case for zero row changes with non-empty
      `columnChanges` (plus three more).
- [x] **[Low]** Column type inferred from at most 100 rows — now every row.
- [x] **[Low]** Footer used London-40; now London-35, the footer token.
- [x] **[Low]** README test count, CLAUDE.md "Primary language: TBD".
- [ ] **[Product gap]** No figure is denominated in money and no column is
      flagged as financial. Summing the numeric delta on detected currency
      columns would close the largest CFO gap. NOT started — this is a
      feature, out of scope for the v1.1 polish arc. Candidate for the
      next arc.

### 9. Open defect — dates shift east of UTC in the Date-object branch

Known since 2026-05-22, recorded only as a doc caveat until now. Filing it as
work: a documented-but-untracked defect has the same half-life as a
prevention rule that was written and never widened — which is exactly what
this project just spent a session learning.

- [ ] `src/lib/normalizer.ts:61` — SheetJS parses slash-format dates as *local*
      midnight. East of UTC, local midnight is the previous UTC day (midnight
      Jan 15 in Tokyo is 15:00 Jan 14 UTC), so the `Date`-object branch's
      `getUTC*` extraction returns the wrong calendar date there. Negative
      offsets are unaffected, which is why it survived: every test and every
      session has run in US Eastern. Both string branches are already UTC-safe
      (verified under `TZ=Asia/Tokyo`); this is the last branch that is not.
      The fix means not trusting SheetJS's timezone anchoring at all —
      likely reading the raw cell text rather than the parsed `Date`. Add a
      `TZ=Asia/Tokyo` case to the suite as part of it.

### 10. Found while verifying — date cells render as raw JS Date strings

A ship date of 2024-02-10 displays as "Fri Feb 09 2024 19:00:00 GMT-0500" —
wrong day, in a finance-facing report. The differ stores the raw cell value
and both the UI and the exports call `String()` on it.

- [x] `src/components/RowChanges.tsx:95` (old/new value cells) and
      `src/lib/export.ts:38` — format `Date` values as `YYYY-MM-DD` for
      display. The normalizer already has the UTC extraction logic; the
      display path never used it. Add a test for the export row content.
      Done 2026-07-28. A third surface the entry did not name:
      `src/lib/summary-generator.ts:153` stringifies the same values to build
      the plain-English transition sentence, so the summary carried the bug
      too. All three now call `formatCellValue` in `src/lib/display.ts`; 9
      tests added. Display is UTC-anchored and therefore inherits task 9's
      east-of-UTC exposure by design — when 9 lands, screen, exports and
      summary all move with it rather than disagreeing.

### 2026-07-31 — Improvement pass (improve + ce code review + UI review)
- **Trigger:** User-initiated combined review. Goal: confirm the tool is
  CEO/CFO-ready, self-explanatory in 30s, and that recent Claude Code work is
  correct (user reported quality concerns lately).
- **What was reviewed:** 5 ce personas over src/ (correctness, maintainability,
  testing, TypeScript, security) + ui-review-skill against the live site.
  Baseline healthy: clean tree, 100 tests, tsc + build clean, in sync with remote.
- **UI verdict:** Passes the 30-second executive test — headline, tagline,
  concrete use cases, and the example-result card make the job obvious. Live
  site renders on-brand (warm canvas, Playfair, Lailara footer). Most ui-review
  FAILs were noise (checker measured `<body>`; credential/staleness hits were in
  minified dist/ bundles) — tightened review.yaml so future runs are clean.
- **What was fixed (11 commits):**
  - **[correctness]** Date-typed KEY columns rendered as raw JS Date strings on
    screen + both exports (RowChanges ×2, export.ts formatKey) — the same defect
    16537dd fixed for cell values but scoped to the repro, not the surface. Now
    routed through formatCellValue. +test.
  - **[correctness]** `wasNormalized` tagged genuine cased text changes as
    "formatting normalized" in case-insensitive mode. +test.
  - **[correctness]** Two all-blank columns scored as a rename (jaccard 0/0→1). +test.
  - **[correctness]** Numeric comma-strip collapsed "1,2,3"→123 (false match);
    now strips only valid thousands separators, shared helper. +tests.
  - **[correctness]** CSV lone-CR not quoted → row-boundary corruption. +tests.
  - **[type-safety]** Removed 3 `as any` casts in differ.ts (typed metadata as
    ColumnMetadata); modeled ColumnChange as a proper discriminated union.
  - **[testing]** exportToExcel had ZERO tests + two false-confidence CSV tests
    (asserted blob.size>0 only) — added real read-back assertions. 100→112.
  - **[security]** Bounded decompression-bomb cell counts + long-header
    Levenshtein cost (both self-DoS, tab-only). +tests. Final: 115 tests.
  - **[UI]** Darkened green/amber result tokens to WCAG AA (green 3.6→5.5:1,
    amber 2.3→4.7:1) using documented DS steps (HK-25, SG-35). Browser-verified.
- **Security posture:** Strong. No Critical/High. CSV formula-injection
  neutralization verified complete. No XSS/innerHTML/eval.
- **Deferred / not touched:** SheetJS xlsx@0.18.5 CVEs (accepted, client-side);
  east-of-UTC Date-object branch (PLAN task 9, still open); blank-key matching
  (intentional). NOT pushed/deployed — local commits only, awaiting user.
- **Next review:** 2026-08-30 (30 days; stable after this pass).

### 2026-07-27 — Improvement pass (improve + code review + UI review)
- **Trigger:** User-initiated combined review; /improve audit was overdue (due 2026-06-19)
- **What was reviewed:** Full src/ code review (background agent), security, UI/first-impression clarity, tests, git hygiene, deps. Baseline healthy: clean tree, 75 tests, TSC clean, no secrets, design system correct.
- **What was fixed (9 items, 7 commits):**
  - **[P1] CSV formula injection** — exported report cells beginning with =,+,-,@ could execute in Excel; now neutralized with a leading apostrophe (plain negatives untouched). +6 tests.
  - **[P2] Rename-detection O(n²)** — B column value-sets rebuilt per iteration; now precomputed once.
  - **[P2] Silent export failures** — added catch handlers + inline error message.
  - **[P2] Missing key column in File B** — now warns instead of silently collapsing all rows.
  - **[P2] Duplicate-row warning count** — now reports rows dropped (agrees with excludedRowCount).
  - **[P2] Stale key auto-detect** — ColumnPicker re-runs detection when files change.
  - **[cleanup] Reordered column change** — removed misleading dead indices.
  - **[UI] Landing copy** — now states audience + stakes for the 30-second test.
  - **[UI] Example result card** + **mobile stacking** (verified no overflow at 375px).
- **Deferred / not touched:** SheetJS xlsx@0.18.5 CVEs (already an accepted, documented decision — client-side blast radius). Row-cap-after-parse (low value). Full real-file click-through QA (browser pane couldn't upload files this session).
- **OPEN QUESTION — blank-key matching:** The code review flagged that two unrelated all-blank-key rows (one in each file) get matched and reported as "modified." This is currently INTENTIONAL and encoded in differ.test.ts ("treats null/empty key values as empty-string key") with excludedRowCount as the honesty mitigation. NOT changed unilaterally. Decide next session: keep as-is, or make blank composite keys non-matchable (would rewrite that test).
- **Next review:** 2026-08-26 (30 days; project stable after this pass)

### 2026-05-22 — Improvement pass
- **Trigger:** First-ever /improve run (project was overdue)
- **What was reviewed:** Security (automated), code quality, dependencies, tests, docs, git hygiene
- **What was fixed:**
  - Fixed Excel serial date offset bug (off-by-one, was 25570 should be 25569)
  - Added 50MB file size limit on uploads
  - Added 200K row count cap to prevent UI freezes
  - Added magic-byte validation for XLSX files
  - Code-split SheetJS and ExcelJS into lazy-loaded chunks (1.5MB → 297KB initial bundle)
  - Error boundary now shows generic message, logs internals to console
  - Updated README from stub to full documentation
  - Documented SheetJS vulnerability acceptance in DECISIONS.md
- **Deferred:** SheetJS replacement (significant refactor, low practical risk for client-side tool)
- **Next review:** 2026-06-19

### 2026-09-23 — Audit (health check only)
- **Findings:** 0 critical, 5 important, 5 nice-to-have
- **Top concerns:** Cell comparison uses only File A's detected column type (differ.ts), so swapping files or comparing CSV vs XLSX can flip results or flag rows whose displayed values look identical (e.g. text date vs Date object). The east-of-UTC Date-branch defect (task 9) is still open. Local checkout sits on the merged client-mode-2026-08 branch, behind origin/main, and HANDOFF/PLAN do not record the Aug client-mode conversion or the Sep og:image commit; CLAUDE.md design-system path is broken.
- **Action taken:** Audit only — no fixes this session
- **Next review:** 2026-12-22
